\arguments{
\item{start_month}{the start month as a character of form YYYY-MM}

1  or "Matching at patient-level migrations in/out"
2  or "Taking average movements from data"}

\item{sql_con}{connection to SQL database}

\item{min_age}{the minimum age to be included in the model}

\item{compare_against}{how many months back in time to compare against, default is 12}
